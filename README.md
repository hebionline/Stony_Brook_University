This repo is used to present my homework in my 2nd master degree, Applied Mathematics and Statistics.

In the top level view, i created several directories based on class name. For example, AMS562, "C++ for scientific programming", is listed as AMS562. There are several small projects (homework) inside.

AMS516 - Statistical Methods in Finance
This project is done by me and Samuel Taieb. It implements a flag-pattern mentioned in a published paper in python, and we use this model to recognize the trading oppotunities in daily training based on stock price change. (i.e. Once the price change follows a flag pattern, we buy; And then we will hold until it reaches take_profit_level to take the profit or stop_loss_level to avoid further loss). I implemented the coding part, and Sam help find 15 minutes data of one specific stock price. Then we validate this trading stretegy with these 15-min trading data in one month.

AMS518 - Advanced Stochastic Models, Risk Assessment, and Portfolio Optimization
In this course, i independently implemented two financial model with Python: one is MCD (Minimum Covariance Determinant, a highly robust estimator of multivariate location and scatter), the other is HMM(Hidden Markov Model), targetted to SPY (ETF for SP500). 

AMS562 - Scientific Programming in C++
This course focuses on scientific computing with C++ 11. This directory contains all my homework in this course.

AMS572 - Data Analysis
The core course for Statistics. This directory contains the workshop to validata FARM-FRENCH Model with R. Data validated covers monthly price data from 1926 to 2019.

AMS603 - Risk Measures for Finance and Data Analysis
A workshop based course. This directory contains my implementation on random walk, implied_volatility, Gaussian Model, using Black-Scholes/Binormial/Random walk to estimate option price.
