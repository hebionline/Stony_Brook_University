# AMS 562 Final Project #

In this project, you will need to doing some simple manipulations on spherical
triangle meshes.

A mesh (unstructured) can be represented by a set of coordinates (geometric data)
and a connectivity table (topological data) that forms the connection relation
between triangles and coordinates.

Your tasks are to finish the three algorithms that declared in `src/manip.hpp`.

To compile

```console
make
```

To do testing

```console
make test
```

To clean directory

```console
make clean
```

To debug with `valgrind`, type

```console
make debug
```

Good luck!
